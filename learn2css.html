                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>If you like the world of <span>web design</span> or are curious to start in this sector,
                    You've probably already heard the term <span>CSS</span>. It is a technology
                    used to provide <span>visual and aesthetic</span> qualities to a web page.
                    If you have never touched this matter, you will see that it is an analytical form,
                    logical and practically mathematical way of creating web pages, but thanks to it we can
                    simplify the creation of pages and get exactly what we are looking for.</p>
                
                <p>The CSS <span>learning curve</span> is usually simple (it is easy to learn how to do things, 
                although it is difficult to master), although it is also true that it can be difficult to adapt 
                if you have never programmed (or are totally unfamiliar with these topics) ), but as you make 
                mistakes and practice, your ability to write CSS code progressively improves, allowing us to 
                progress at an ever-faster pace. </p>

                <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
                <p>Before you start, you should be clear about a key concept: a web page is really <span>a text 
                    document</span>. In said document, <span>HTML code</span> is written, with which the content of 
                    a website is created. On the other hand, there is the <span>CSS code</span>, which, together with 
                    the HTML code, allows us to give shape, color, position (and other visual characteristics) to a page.</p>
                
                <p> The acronym <span>CSS</span> stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" and starts from a simple but very powerful 
                    concept: apply <span>styles</span> (colors, shapes, margins, etc...) to one or more documents (usually HTML 
                    documents, web pages) in bulk.</p>

                <p>It is called cascading styles because they are applied from top to bottom (following a pattern called inheritance
                     that we will discuss later) and if there is ambiguity, a series of rules are followed to resolve it. </p>
                
                <p>The idea of CSS is to use the concept of separation of presentation and content, trying to make documents
                    HTML include only information and data, related to the meaning of the information to be transmitted (the content), and all
                    the aspects related to the style (layout, colors, shapes, etc...) are in a separate CSS document </p>

                <p>In this way, everything related to visual design can be unified in a single CSS document, and with it, several advantages:</p>

        <div class=list2>
                <ul id="square">
                    <li>If we need to make visual modifications we do it in one place. We don't need to edit all the HTML 
                        in question separately.</li>

                    <li>Duplicating styles in different places is reduced, making it easier to organize and make changes. 
                        In addition, in the end the 
                        information to be transmitted is considerably less (the pages are downloaded faster).</li>

                    <li>It is easier to create different versions of the presentation for other types of devices: 
                        tablets, smartphones or mobile devices, etc...</li>
                </ul>
